# Information_display_screen
This project was undertaken in the fourth year at NTI Södertörn. We were assigned to create a website that would display information about our teacher on a screen outside his office.

## Requirements
The project requirements involved developing three pages. The first page was designed as a landing page featuring contact details, a photo of the teacher, the current weather and date, a QR code for booking appointments, and the teacher's availability status. 

The second page was intended for users who scanned the QR code, directing them to a scheduling page where they could book a meeting at times predetermined by the teacher.

The final page served as an admin interface for the teacher, allowing them to set bookable times. If an appointment was booked, it would be displayed on this page, where the teacher could edit the details as necessary.
